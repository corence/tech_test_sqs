The main concepts that we want to test are:
 - given a lot of messages, do all of them get sent?
 - given high concurrency, does it still work?

Testing specific methods:
 - CreateQueue
  -- provoke each possible error at least once
 - SendMessage
  -- provoke each possible error at least once
  -- send in parallel from multiple clients at the same time -- try to provoke race conditions
 - ReceiveMessage
  -- provoke each possible error at least once
 - DeleteMessage
  -- don't delete the message, wait for the time to elapse, and see if it gets deleted anyway

Things to keep in mind about the standard sqs queue are:
 - messages may come more than once -- we need to handle this correctly in the test code
 - messages may come out of order -- so we are not testing ordering at all
